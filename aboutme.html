		<h3 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h3>
		<p>Hi, I'm Bogdan. I'm a game developer with 8 years of programming experience and 5 years of game development experience. I love solving tough technical problems and constantly push myself to get better. I'm highly competitive, ambitious, and have been passionate about computers and gaming for as long as I can remember.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h3 id="what-i-do">What I do</h3>
		<p>I specialize in gameplay programming. In school, I was the nerdy kid who loved math more than anything else and I had a knack for it. I picked up programming as soon as I discovered how accessible it is. When the time came to use it in some practical application, gaming was perfect for me. It was enjoyable and incredibly technically challenging, and that was exactly what I needed. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h3 id="how-i-do-it">How I do it</h3>
		<p>I approach gameplay systems with a balance of logic and design sensibility. I focus on creating mechanics that are consistent, scalable, and intuitive to players. I make my code and system architecture clear to ensure maintainability. Before implementing anything, I think about how it fits into the player experience, how it interacts with the rest of the game and if it has a good place in it. Good gameplay design isn't just about fun, it's also about reducing frustration and ambiguity.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h3 id="what-i-use">What I use</h3>
		<p>I mainly use Godot Engine, but I don't like to limit myself to specific tools. I've worked in Unity, I've dabbled with Unreal Engine but it was always overkill for what I had in mind. Apart from that, I'm very well versed in other pieces of software such as Blender, Photoshop, Audacity and most other major programs.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h3 id="how-i-learn">How I learn</h3>
		<p>As a kid, once I learned the ropes of using a computer, I immediately became independent. I loved being able to rely on only myself (and the internet) to learn exactly what I wanted. This naturally led to my technical knowledge being very broad. It significantly helped my ability to learn and it made me feel very secure in myself. I still regularly learn new skills every day and take pride in that.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h3 id="what-ive-worked-on">What I've worked on</h3>
		<p>I began programming in fifth grade through a specialized competitive programming class, which gave me an amazing foundation in problem-solving. Since then, I've explored a range of fields: web development, algorithms, software engineering, microcontrollers, and especially game development. Some of this was for school, some for personal interest.</p>
		<p>In 2021, I started participating in game jams and hackathons. These experiences taught me how to work efficiently under pressure, communicate within a team, and deliver fully functional games on tight deadlines. I also met a lot of people through these events, which led to very valuable opportunities.</p>
		<p>One of those was Artemi. In April 2024, a friend invited me to join the project as a programmer. It was my first serious experience with Unity. A few months in, I also started a job while attending college full time. The workload became unsustainable, and by November, I had to make the decision to step away from Artemi to prioritize my health and long-term goals.</p>
		<p>Since then, I've focused on developing and publishing my own projects. Along with teammates from previous game jams, I revived a project called Bad Week, and it's currently still in development.</p>

		<h3 id="what-my-goals-are">What my goals are</h3>
		<p>My main goal is to create games that leave a lasting impact, whether that's through mechanics, systems design, story, or memorable player experiences. In the long term, I'm aiming to lead and contribute to projects that push gameplay systems and the player experience forward.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h3 id="how-i-collaborate">How I collaborate</h3>
		<p>When it comes to working with others, I'm usually the type to be quiet and listen until I have something smart to say. Maybe it's an idea to implement or maybe it's a complaint. I make sure to tell it how it is, though.</p>
		<p>Most of my experience comes from game jams, where the atmosphere is much more intense than usual, so I've learned to adapt to that.</p>
